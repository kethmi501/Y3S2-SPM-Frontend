## Project Description
Regarding the Life on Land, the social credit system for ecosystem management is the concept that we created. Consequently, we propose to construct a webpage on The Social Credit System for Ecosystem Management. This strategy encourages people to safeguard plants and animals in their local environment. They are rewarded social credits in recognition of their outstanding contributions to the ecosystem. Such as when endemic creatures and flora are discovered, expanding the data collection by adding new data, and posting picturesque photographs of the district. On the homepage, the total social credits for each district will be presented on a leaderboard. There are distinct areas for adding additional plants, animals, and destinations. In addition, there is a collection page for each list entity. Each list of entities can be improved by adding more information to the "Memory cards," which contain vital, undiscovered data about the animals and trees. These memory cards assist users in learning about and exploring the animal or tree itself. In addition, panorama uploading options will be added to accommodate professional photographers. Therefore, their proficiency can be exhibited on the collection page, and selected images will be featured in the Header. Each user can finally view their collection on the "My collection" page.		

## Technologies:
Nextjs, Reactjs jsprint


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/[...slug].js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
